### Chess

I am an avid chess fan, and played in tournaments in high school and at
Cal, eventually earning the Expert title (with a peak USCF rating ~2100). 
I'd like to go for the USCF master title (the next level up) someday, when I
have more time. 

While at Cal, I made an opening repertoire using Chessbase to prepare and train for tournaments: 

* [Repertoire for White Pieces](/chess/white_repertoire/base.htm)  
* [Repertoire for Black Pieces](/chess/black_repertoire/base.htm)

### Dancing

I enjoy social tango dancing and salsa dancing in my spare time. I recently improvised 
a tango and waltz performance with an excellent follower.
